# SaaS Template

This is a basic template which features user registration, login, and password reset. It consists of a dashboard and account settings pages, where users can update their information.

## Stack

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) as the frontend framework
- [Carbon UI](https://carbon-components-svelte.onrender.com/) as the UI system
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM
- [Lucia Auth](https://lucia-auth.vercel.app/) for user authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```bash
  git clone
```

2. Install dependencies

```

3. Start the database
